## Project description:
A software program that generates a randomly populated map featuring designated starting and ending points, as well as various obstructions. This program determines the shortest possible route between the start and end points, avoiding the obstacles along the way.

## Installations:

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   cd shortest-Path-On-A-Random-Graph
   
2. Python Installations:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   pip install matplotlib

## Logic operations:
The project is divided into 2 parts:

Python script that generates a randomly populated map featuring designated starting and ending points, as well as various points of polygons.
Create a map that includes start and end points, and polygons
